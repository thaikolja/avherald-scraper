**[The Aviation Herald](https://avherald.com/)** is a website [registered](https://avherald.com/h?impressum=) to the Austrian NOMIS SOFT Data Processing Limited Liability Company that documents aviation accidents and incidents. It's known for its detailed reports, often compiled from various sources. This Python 3 script can be used to extract data from the website by scraping.

## Description

### Scraping

Since avherald.com does not have a [RESTful API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/), [RSS Feed](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-are-rss-feeds-e8aaebc3-a0a7-40cd-9e10-88f9c1e74b97), or other ways to get data without visiting the website, this Python 3 script will extract the data for you using [website scraping](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/what-is-web-scraping/).

Adjust the number of pages in the code at `MAX_PAGES_TO_SCRAPE` to avoid getting blocked immediately. A `REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS` of `1` second is also a good way to avoid DDoS-lookalike requests, quickly leading to a ban on your IP address.

### Saving

This script stores the information it gathers in an [SQLite database](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/sql-tutorial/what-is-sqlite) called `data.sqlite`. You can set up a CRON job to run this script every 24 hours with `MAX_PAGES_TO_SCRAPE` set to `1`. The script will gather the latest data from the first page while ignoring duplicates.
